# Deployment Status

## Local Build: ✅ SUCCESS
- Tested: October 31, 2025 at 11:36 PM
- Command: `npm run build`
- Result: Build completed successfully
- All 11 pages generated correctly
- No errors, only ESLint warnings about `<img>` tags (non-critical)

## Netlify Build: ❌ FAILING
- Error: "Build script returned non-zero exit code: 2"
- Cause: **Publish directory is set to `.next` in Netlify UI**
- This is a **configuration issue**, NOT a code issue

## Fix Required
**You must clear the Publish directory setting in Netlify UI**

### Quick Fix Steps:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Site settings → Build & deploy → Continuous Deployment
3. Edit settings → Clear the "Publish directory" field (remove `.next`)
4. Save
5. Trigger a new deploy

### Why This Fixes It:
- The `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` in `netlify.toml` handles deployment automatically
- It expects NO publish directory to be set
- When `.next` is set in the UI, it conflicts with the plugin
- Clearing it allows the plugin to work correctly

## Files Changed (Latest Commit: 8bec966)
- ✅ Gallery.tsx - New photo order
- ✅ CVSection.tsx - Removed CV button
- ✅ scout-photo-new.jpg - New image added
- ✅ netlify.toml - Already correct (no changes needed)

## Next Steps
1. Clear Netlify publish directory (see NETLIFY_FIX.md)
2. Redeploy on Netlify
3. Site should go live successfully

    "content": "The Scouting Movement in Egypt is one of the oldest scouting movements in the world, and since its inception, it has played a prominent national and educational role in Egyptian society.\n\nThe idea first emerged in Egypt in the early twentieth century, shortly after Lord Baden-Powell founded the World Scouting Movement in England in 1907. It did not take long for the concept to spread to Egypt via foreign schools, missions, and European communities. The Egyptians soon embraced it with great enthusiasm.\n\nSome scout troops were informally formed in schools, first in Alexandria and then in Cairo, around 1914, despite the opposition of the British occupation. Perhaps the most notable manifestation of this opposition was the attempt to exile and deport several of the early Egyptian scout leaders.\n\nAfter World War I in 1918, the movement rapidly expanded in both public and private schools. One of its most prominent supporters at the time was His Majesty King Fuad I, who saw it as a means of raising the youth with discipline, order, and patriotism. Consequently, he ordered its incorporation under the wing of the Ministry of Education (Ministry of Knowledge).\n\nEgyptian Scouting soon flourished and became an integral part of public life, participating in national events, royal processions, and official celebrations. It also played a significant role in supporting the 1919 Revolution by organizing supplies, relaying messages, and assisting the wounded, thus solidifying its image as a national movement rather than merely a youth activity.\n\nThe first official scouting association, the Egyptian Scout Association (Gam'eyet El-Kashafa El-Masreya), was formally established in 1920 to be the organizing body for the movement in the country. It quickly organized major events, the most notable of which was inviting Lord Baden-Powell to visit Egypt in a grand scout festival in 1921. The Association joined the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1922 after receiving international recognition, making Egypt one of the first Arab nations to officially join the global movement.\n\nIn the period before the July 1952 Revolution, Egyptian Scouting enjoyed the patronage of the Royal Family (the Muhammad Ali Dynasty), as it was considered a tool for instilling loyalty and national belonging in the youth. Key expressions of this patronage included the investiture of His Royal Highness Prince Farouk as Chief Scout, Her Majesty Queen Farida as Chief Guide, and Princess Ferial as Chief Cub/Brownie (Zahra). Scouting was also a permanent guest at most royal celebrations.\n\nFollowing the July 1952 Revolution, the movement was reorganized, initiating a new phase of expansion and institutional framing. This led to the creation of the current associations in 1954: the Scouts (Boys), Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, and Girl Guides. In the same year, Egypt was a founding member of the Arab Scout Organization, playing a pioneering role in spreading the scouting movement throughout the Arab world.\n\nEgyptian Scouts have participated in numerous national events, such as the war effort, blood donation campaigns, and literacy and environmental service projects. Its leadership continues to this day, as its hosting of the World Scout Conference in 2024 confirms its leading position in the global scouting arena, more than 110 years after its establishment.\n\nToday, Egyptian Scouting represents a living heritage that combines authenticity and renewal, continuing its mission to educate generations on the values of belonging, discipline, and community service. Egypt is also rich in a venerable scouting heritage of documents, photos, and symbols that chronicle a long journey of contribution and impact, which the Egyptian Scout Archive—the largest scout archive in the Arab world—is working to preserve and document for future generations. I am proud to be one of its founders."
